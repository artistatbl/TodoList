# TodoList
In order to help my friendsÂ be more productive, I designed a website where they may enter tasks. The online app enables the user to add tasks, complete them, and delete them. Additionally, I created a function that lets the user choose between a dark colour theme and a light colour theme. In order for all the information to be saved in the user's local storage in the browsers when they chose to return to the site after leaving it, I also implemented local storage.
